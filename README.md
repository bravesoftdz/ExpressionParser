ExpressionParser

Simple math expression parser, created as a proof of concept back in the day.
Not aimed at production environment, this is for testing purposes only.

There are two versions, one is purely imperative and the other one is purely object oriented...
Nahhhh, just pulling you leg, that is absolutely NOT OOP. It's just the same imperative code wrapped in an ill conceived object.

Have fun... ;)
